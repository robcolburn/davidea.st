      Most things in web development are difficult.

    <p>
      Despite knowing this I'm able to lie to myself at the beginning every project. "This won't be that difficult. Two days tops."  But it always happens. I hit a resistance point that forces me to stop and say, "This is gonna take awhile."

      I started this post two weeks ago as a simple "How to use SSR to boost performance" article. After hours and profiling and consulting people much smarter than me, I know one thing. Server-side Rendering is more nuanced than you would like.

      This is not a "beware SSR" article. SSR can still help with performance in certain scenarios. There's just a few quirks you should be aware of.

    <h3>JavaScript handcuffs the content of a single-page app</h3>

    <p>
      The default setup for a single-page app is an "app" element with some scripts. The "app" element inflates into meaningful content once the scripts run.
    </p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
           &lt;title&gt;My non ssr app&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;my-app&gt;&lt;/my-app&gt;
            &lt;!-- "my-app" is a white page until these big scripts load --&gt;
            &lt;script src="big-script.876aa678as463sf7.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            &lt;script src="other-big-script.876aa678as463sf7.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
     &lt;/html&gt;
