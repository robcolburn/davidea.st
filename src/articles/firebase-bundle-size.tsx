              I'm a Developer Advocate for Google on the Firebase team. I have been for over 4 years, an eternity in the tech industry. We have this cloud database called Firestore. We host the database and you interface with it using our JavaScript library. It's awesome. Firestore synchronizes data in realtime and works fully offline. <strong>Fully</strong>. <strong>Offline</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              These features make Firestore a great tool for building apps on the web. However, there is one problem. <strong>It's not exactly the lightest</strong>.

            <p>
              This all started when I was building a Firestore app with Webpack. I started off with a basic <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> setup. This lead to a nice a tiny JavaScript bundle.
            </p>
            
            <CodeBox
              code={SAMPLE_WEBPACK_PREACT}
              language="bash" />

            <p>
              Only 12.3kb (4.5kb gzipped!)? Nice. But then I added Firestore.
            </p>

            <p>
              Webpack has this nifty little notification that informs you if any JavaScript asset is over 244kb in size. <em>Why 244kb?</em> If you rely on 244kb+ of JavaScript to load before the page can render, you're going to have a bad time. <strong>And here I sat looking at the following notification</strong>:
            </p>

            <CodeBox
              code={SAMPLE_WEBPACK_WARN}
              language="bash" />

            <p>
              Adding Firestore increased my bundle size nearly 300kbs. Webpack was right. This did impact web performance. I was about to have a bad time. <strong>Thanks, Webpack</strong>.

              <em>Why is it so slow?</em> For starters, this trace was done on a MotoG4 on a "Slow3G" connection using WebpageTest. <em>But the real reason?</em> The app can't render until the JavaScript bundle downloads, parses, and executes. This is disastrous on slow connections. Look at the waterfall chart.

              <strong>The problem is how I'm loading the app.</strong> The user has to wait for the JavaScript bundle <strong>311kbs</strong> (86.5 kbs gzipped) <em>and</em> the subsequent network requests for the app to load.

            <p>
              This made me sad. Firestore gave me realtime and offline. Realtime made my app interesting, offline made it useful. <strong>But these features come at a cost</strong>. It takes a lot of bytes of code to implement a persistent connection with a server, state synchronization across devices, persisting state offline, and synchronizing state back the server when online once again.

              Break the app out into small layers. Each layer of the app provides use to the user. The app becomes more useful as each feature loads.

          </p>

          <p>
            The HTML is available for immediate rendering. The browser renders the embedded CSS without loading a stylesheet. The JavaScript framework uses the initial JSON to provide functionality before the network data loads from Firestore.

              Server side rendering isn't a silver bullet for increasing performance. What server side rendering gives you is a faster first paint of your content.

            The app has content at 2.3 seconds, <em>which is great!</em> But look at those red blocks at the bottom. Those are times where the main thread becomes too busy to process any user input. The result is a frozen user interface. The app isn't fully interactive until around 9.2 seconds. This isn't better than before and on lower powered devices this version might be worse.
          </p>

          <p>
            There's still room for improvement even if you're okay with the frozen thread. It took 4.5 seconds for the browser to download, parse, and execute the JavaScript bundle.

              This is the moment you've been waiting for. <em>How did I drop 95% of JavaScript bundle?</em> Well... I put it in another bundle. Preact, Firestore, and my own app code add up to 86.5kbs of gzipped JavaScript. Firestore is the bulk of that weight.

              Removing Firestore drops the gzipped bundle to 4.5kbs. That's a 95% reduction in bundle size! <em>How can I remove Firestore without removing the features?</em> <strong>Web Workers</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>Web Workers</h3>

            <p>
              Web Workers are scripts that run in background threads. They are useful beacuse they give you another thread to perform operations in. When your code is clogs the main thread, it might help to move that code to a worker. This can help free up the main thread and keep the app interactive.
            </p>

            <CodeBox
              code={SAMPLE_SIMPLE_WORKER}
              filePath="index.ts"
              language="ts" />

            <p></p>

            <CodeBox
              code={SAMPLE_WORKER_TIMER}
              filePath="worker.js"
              language="js" />

            <p>
              In the example above the main thread recieves a message every second from the worker. This is exactly the type of synchronization I need from Firestore.

            <p>
              There are two main benefits to using Web Workers with Firestore.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The first is the <strong>processing work in another thread</strong>. The server side rendered app freezes at 9.1 seconds when Firestore data loads and Preact has to render new changes. We can free up the thread by off-loading Firestore processing to a worker.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The second is the <strong>async loading of Firestore</strong>. The worker script isn't apart of the bundle because it loads asynchronously. The worker object on the main thread acts as a proxy to the worker thread. I can start to post messages to the worker thread to act on before it loads.
            </p>

            <p>
              A large drawback is managing workers. Web Workers are highly unstructured and always async. It is really difficult to manage work through one <code>postMessage</code> method and listener. However, using libraries like <code><a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink">Comlink</a></code> really simplify your code. Don't do what I did with my crazy worker code, use Comlink.

            This split gives me two bundles: main thread code and worker code. The main thread code is responsible for the view and the worker code is for data over the network. The app can get to interactive a lot faster with this smaller bundle.
